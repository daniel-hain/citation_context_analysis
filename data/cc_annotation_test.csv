1;B1-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Introduction;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified to cause a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [[_REF#_]].;;;
2;B4-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Introduction;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;Lower education level was reported to be associated with a stronger agreement with COVID-19 misinformation [[_REF#_]], poorer knowledge and practices regarding COVID-19 protection [[_REF_],[_REF_]], which may, in turn, lead to increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection or worse COVID-19 outcomes.;;;
3;B4-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Discussion;5. Explanation;H;Meanwhile, they were also reported to have lower education levels [[_REF#_],[_REF_],[_REF_]].;;;
4;B7-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Introduction;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;Although studies have reported that lower education attainment was associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization or mortality [[_REF#_],[_REF_],[_REF_],[_REF_],[_REF_],[_REF_],[_REF_]], whether the relationship is causal remains unclear. Notably, education attainment is phenotypically and genetically correlated with intelligence, and bidirectional causation exists between the two traits [[_REF_]].;;;
5;B7-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Discussion;9. Similarity/Consistency;H;Our analysis also revealed an inverse causal effect of genetically determined education attainment on COVID-19 hospitalization, which is consistent with the finding from the only available observational study conducted using electronic medical records serving Eastern Massachusetts of the United States [[_REF#_]].;;;
6;B10-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Introduction;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;Although studies have reported that lower education attainment was associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization or mortality [[_REF_],[_REF_],[_REF_],[_REF#_],[_REF_],[_REF_],[_REF_]], whether the relationship is causal remains unclear. Notably, education attainment is phenotypically and genetically correlated with intelligence, and bidirectional causation exists between the two traits [[_REF_]].;;;
7;B10-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Discussion;9. Similarity/Consistency;H;Thus, our study finding implied that genetic predisposition to higher education attainment may causally lower the risk of COVID-19-associated deaths, which is partially in line with most of the published observational studies in the United States [[_REF_]], Sweden [[_REF#_]].;;;
8;B13-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Introduction;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;Although studies have reported that lower education attainment was associated with increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 hospitalization or mortality [[_REF_],[_REF_],[_REF_],[_REF_],[_REF_],[_REF_],[_REF#_]], whether the relationship is causal remains unclear. Notably, education attainment is phenotypically and genetically correlated with intelligence, and bidirectional causation exists between the two traits [[_REF_]].;;;
9;B13-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Discussion;5. Explanation;H;While observational studies demonstrated that individuals with lower education attainment had an increased risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection [[_REF_],[_REF#_]], one possible explanation is that observational studies are subjected to residual confounding.;;;
10;B16-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Study design and data sources;7. Data;M;"The largest publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) or GWAS meta-analysis of exposure (education attainment [[_REF#_]] (defined as the number of years of schooling; N = 1,131,881 individuals from 71 cohorts) and intelligence [[_REF_]] (a latent factor denoted as general intelligence or Spearman?s<italic toggle=""yes"">g</italic>; N = 269,867 individuals from 14 cohorts)) and outcome (SARS-CoV-2 infection, COVID-19 related hospitalization and severity [[_REF_]]) were used as the data sources.";;;
11;B16-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Study design and data sources;7. Data;M;For instance, both the GWAS meta-analysis of education attainment [[_REF#_]] comprised participants from the U.K. Biobank.;;;
12;B16-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;MR analyses;7.

13;B16-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Discussion;7. Data;H;In contrast, our current study had higher statistical power due to the use of more than 1110 independent SNPs derived from the same but complete data set consisting of 1,131,881 individuals as genetic instruments [[_REF#_]].;;;
14;B19-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Study design and data sources;4. Evaluation;M;Notably, biases could result if both the case and control participants in the outcome data set are also in the exposure data set [[_REF#_]].;;;
15;B19-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Discussion;5. Explanation;M;A major strength of this study is the use of two-sample MR analysis with minimal sample overlap, which was reported to provide a less biased causal estimate than one-sample MR analysis [[_REF#_]].;;;
16;B19-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Discussion;5. Explanation;H;With the increase in sample overlap, bias toward the confounded association might be present [[_REF#_]].;;;

19;B28-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Discussion;5. Explanation;H;In times of crisis such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome [[_REF#_],[_REF_]], individuals with higher education attainment demonstrated better preparedness and adaptiveness in peculiar and unfamiliar situations by showcasing a higher level of knowledge and health literacy, adopting self-care and risk-avoidance behavior, and having increased awareness of the need to seek medical advice timely.;;;
20;B31-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Discussion;5. Explanation;H;Along with the COVID-19 pandemic, related misinformation and conspiracy theories were widespread through informal personal networks or via social media platforms [[_REF#_]].;;;
21;B34-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Discussion;4. Evaluation;H;An example is the number of people per unit of living area, as cramped living condition disables social distancing and may increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [[_REF#_]].;;;
22;B37-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Discussion;5. Explanation;H;People who believe in conspiracy theories and misinformation had increased vaccine hesitancy [[_REF_],[_REF_],[_REF#_],[_REF_],[_REF_],[_REF_]], increased support for the controversial treatment against COVID-19 (hydroxychloroquine) [[_REF_],[_REF_]], as well as poorer engagement in health-protective behavior against COVID-19 [[_REF#_],[_REF_],[_REF_]].;;;

24;B43-jcm-10-04870;PMC8584527.xml;Discussion;5. Explanation;H;Notably, vaccination did not only protect individuals against the infection of SARS-CoV-2, but vaccines such as Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1-S could also reduce the risk of COVID-19 related hospitalization [[_REF#_],[_REF_]], severe or critical COVID-19 related hospitalization [[_REF_]], and mortality [[_REF#_],[_REF_]].;;;

28;R1;PMC7918808.xml;Introduction;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;The emergence of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 in China at the end of 2019 produced a pandemic of COVID-19 characterised by fever, cough, pneumonia and other respiratory symptoms, with many patients also developing a systemic inflammatory crisis, sometimes considered a cytokine storm.[_REF#_];;;

66;B10;PMC8602063.xml;Introduction;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;Only a few studies have assessed the association of smoking and testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the population level with further adjustment for comorbidities and socioeconomic and demographic factors ([_REF_]?[_REF#_]).;;;
67;B10;PMC8602063.xml;Introduction;3. Contrast/Conflict;H;Results are contradictory, with some studies reporting a negative association ([_REF_],[_REF_]), while others showing positive ([_REF_]), or no association ([_REF#_]).;;;
68;B10;PMC8602063.xml;Discussion;9. Similarity/Consistency;H;Like previous studies ([_REF_]?[_REF#_]), we found a positive association of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 with older age (only in models stratified for men and the non-healthcare population,[_REF_]), being male, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, and having a known exposure to COVID-19. ;;;
69;B1;PMC8602063.xml;Introduction;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;Smoking is considered a risk factor for respiratory infectious diseases ([_REF#_]).;;;
70;B2;PMC8602063.xml;Introduction;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;However, much of the evidence shows that smoking is negatively associated with COVID-19 and its complications, and to date, there is still an ongoing debate about the role smoking plays in the infection risk for SARS-CoV-2 ([_REF#_]).;;;
71;B3;PMC8602063.xml;Introduction;1. Background/Perfunctory;h;On one hand, some authors attribute a protective effect due to nicotine and its interaction with the immune and renin-angiotensin systems ([_REF#_]).;;;
72;B4;PMC8602063.xml;Introduction;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;"On the contrary, other studies suggest that this negative association could be due to methodological bias; with most of the studies being from hospital settings and having underrepresented smoking prevalence ([_REF#_],[_REF_]).";;;

330;CR5;PMC8860623.xml;Background;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;Access to testing has also changed across the course of the pandemic [[_REF#_]], meaning earlier studies were more likely to focus on people with symptomatic disease or a history of travel, or on specific populations such as healthcare workers.;;;
331;CR11;PMC8860623.xml;Background;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;Serology studies also offer the opportunity to identify determinants of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titres, which are a recognised correlate of protection against future infection [[_REF#_],[_REF_]].;;;

346;CR15;PMC8860623.xml;Background;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;It has been speculated that there is a J-shaped relationship between exercise load and susceptibility to infection, whereby moderate exercise can improve immune response, but prolonged, high-intensity exercise can increase susceptibility to infection [[_REF#_]].;;;
347;CR15;PMC8860623.xml;Procedures;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;Using UK biobank data, being tested for COVID-19 was associated with male sex, Black ethnicity, lower socioeconomic status, occupation (being a health care worker, unemployed, or retired), comorbidities, exposure to particulate matter (PM) 2.5 absorbance, and ever smoker [[_REF#_]].;;;
348;CR15;PMC8860623.xml;Procedures;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;Among the tested individuals, only non-White ethnicity, male sex, and lower education were associated with a COVID-19 positive diagnosis [[_REF#_]].;;;
349;CR17;PMC8860623.xml;Procedures;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;Previous studies also found that several underlying health conditions, higher household income, and occupation (health care worker) were associated with COVID-19 testing [[_REF_],[_REF#_]].;;;

352;CR23;PMC8860623.xml;Discussion;5. Explanation;H;In the UK biobank data study, ethnicity (non-Whites) and lower education were associated with COVID-19 positive diagnosis [[_REF#_]].;;;
353;CR25;PMC8860623.xml;Discussion;5. Explanation;H;However, both in this study and the UK biobank data study among tested persons, no significant association between comorbidities or health risk factors with a COVID-19 positive diagnosis was found [[_REF#_]].;;;
354;CR27;PMC8860623.xml;Discussion;5. Explanation;H;Like the UK study [[_REF#_]], we found that having comorbidities increased the odds of COVID-19 testing but not with the risk of testing positive.;;;
355;CR3;PMC8882718.xml;Background;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;This finding may suggest that having comorbidities may assist in predicting the risk of developing COVID-19 symptoms, and therefore the probability of getting a COVID-19 test [[_REF#_]].;;;
356;CR3;PMC8882718.xml;Background;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;Some variables, such as COVID-19 symptoms, previous use of health care services, obesity, and smoking, that have been found affecting COVID-19 testing uptake [[_REF_],[_REF#_]] were not assessed in this survey and should be included in future studies.;;;
357;CR3;PMC8882718.xml;Discussion;5. Explanation;H;A positive test early in the course of the illness enables individuals to isolate themselves thereby reducing the chances of infecting others and allowing them to seek treatment earlier, likely reducing disease severity and the risk of long-term disability, or death.?

358;CR3;PMC8882718.xml;Discussion;3. Contrast/Conflict;H;A negative test on the other hand does not exempt one from possibly acquiring and transmitting the infection in the future [[_REF#_]].;;;
359;CR3;PMC8882718.xml;Discussion;3. Contrast/Conflict;H;Therefore, even if an individual is tested negative at a given time point, continuation of safe hygienic measures (washing hands with soaps/using sanitizers frequently, physical distancing, and wearing a face mask) is recommended to protect self and others from COVID-19 [[_REF#_]].;;;
360;CR3;PMC8882718.xml;Discussion;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;A positive test means isolation is mandatory, and that others with whom the individual may have been in contact since the time of exposure should also get tested [[_REF#_]].;;;
361;CR3;PMC8882718.xml;Discussion;5. Explanation;H;Since nearly half of all SARS-CoV-2 infections are transmitted by pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic people, early identification of infected individuals will play a major role in containing the pandemic [[_REF#_]].;;;
362;CR3;PMC8882718.xml;Discussion;5. Explanation;H;Indeed, a meta-analytic study showed that the pooled prevalence of healthcare workers testing positive for COVID-19 was between 7 to 11% [[_REF#_]], compared to 0.46 to 1.82% in a German population-based cohort study [[_REF_]].;;;
363;CR3;PMC8882718.xml;Discussion;5. Explanation;H;Health care workers have been identified as a high-risk group for contracting and spreading the COVID-19 virus, due to exposure to symptomatic and asymptomatic patients in healthcare settings, a lack of adherence to preventive measures, and the lack of personal protective equipment [[_REF#_]].;;;
364;CR3;PMC8882718.xml;Study limitations;4. Evaluation;H;Health care utilization in terms of COVID-19 testing uptake can be assessed using the Andersen behavioural model explaining that health care utilization is determined by predisposing, enabling/disabling, and needing factors [[_REF#_]].;;;

368;CR1;PMC8882718.xml;Background;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;In Thailand the low rate of COVID-19 positive diagnosis may be attributed to a low prevalence of COVID-19 infection (7.5% among hospital patients) [[_REF#_]], and a low-test positive ratio (1.3, January?March 2021) [[_REF_]], and a high compliance to COVID-19 preventive measures in Thailand [[_REF_]].;;;

377;CR16;PMC8882718.xml;Background;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;The higher rate of COVID-19 positive diagnosis in Bangladesh may be explained by a higher prevalence of COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh (15.1%) [[_REF_]], and the reluctance of people to get tested for COVID-19, when they have no or only moderate COVID-19 symptoms [[_REF#_]].;;;
378;CR19;PMC8882718.xml;Background;1. Background/Perfunctory;H;Other studies have likewise found that those who reside in urban areas are more likely to contract the COVID-19 virus compared to rural areas and small towns [[_REF#_],[_REF_]].;;;
